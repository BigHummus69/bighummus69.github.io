##  How to deploy

### Deploy on Github

To deploy this site on Github, simpily fork and go to the repository's settings.

Then, in the sidebar, in the Code and Automation section click on the button named Pages.

Under Build and Deployment, under Source, select **Deploy from a Branch**

Under Build and Deployment, use the branch dropdown menu and select the publishing source called "master".

Click Save.

### Deploy on local machine

I have no idea how to deploy on a local machine, because the Jekyll theme is built specifically for Github Pages.
